## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn about Java Unit Testing because you need to plan to be able to run tests in a project. It adds extra time to the development but helps to guarantee that the program will respond adequately in the future.

***Proactiveness*** is important to learn about Java Unit Testing because running tests proactively is needed to prevent errors in the program after itâ€™s done.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Consistently and proactively run tests to check code is correct
