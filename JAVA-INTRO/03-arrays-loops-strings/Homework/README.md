## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn about Arrays, Arraylists, Loops, and Strings because understanding the importance of the fundamentals of Computer Science will allow you to easily learn new programming languages and frameworks. For example, arrays are a key skill to learn to handle larger data structures. Learning new skills will help you develop your career further and increase the likelihood of a promotion!

***Proactiveness*** is important to learn about Arrays, Arraylists, Loops, and Strings because when solving a complex problem like organising data and extracting meaning from large data sets, you need to look at different sources and libraries to find the best possible solution. You will never be able to find the right solution on the first try. Developers must be proactive and methodical to try different things and measure the outputs of different attempts to solve a problem.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
