## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn about object oriented Java because you need to understand and believe that you can practise and improve over time. It is needed to understand how to get smarter through hard work, the use of effective strategies, and help from others when needed. Object oriented programming breaks down complicated problems into manageable parts. However, mastering object oriented programming takes time and practice

***Communication*** is important to learn about object oriented Java because it is key when working on a team and when designing programming applications. In designing with object oriented principles, code will be easier to understand and easier to reuse if it is written well and communicated clearly from the start.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
