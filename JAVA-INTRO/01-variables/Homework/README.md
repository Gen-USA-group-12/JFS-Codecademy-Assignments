## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Growth mindset*** is important to learn Java because itâ€™s not easy to learn something new, especially a new programming language. You will need to remember that you have the ability to learn new things and master them with practice!

***Orientation to detail*** is important to learn Java because it helps you to become better at coding in a new programming language. The only way to be a good developer is to keep on trying until you finally are able to make the computer do exactly what you need. The more you program, the better you become at spotting errors and understanding them.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
