## Keep In Mind

### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Persistence*** is important to learn about Inheritance and Polymorphism because you will need a well trained eye when programming, and it takes practice to master this skill.

***Orientation to detail*** is important to learn about Inheritance and Polymorphism because effectively applying inheritance concepts requires close attention to parts of the code/project where it's possible to define generic classes which can be inherited by more specific classes that share common characteristics, thus speeding up development and facilitating knowledge transfer.

### Performance Goals for this Unit

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion
